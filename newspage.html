      <p>India is the world's biggest producer of sugar, cotton and pulses and the second-biggest producer of wheat and rice. The success of these crops is largely determined by the June-September monsoon, which delivers about 70% of the country's annual rainfall.</p>
      <p>While rains would normally cheer the agricultural heartland, the monsoon was erratic and has left many crops damaged this year in India.</p>

    <p>India (IND) vs South Africa (SA) Live Cricket Score 2nd Test Day 2: Captain Virat Kohli and vice-captain Ajinkya Rahane have seen off the threat of the 2nd new ball with considerable patience and poise. While Kohli is nearing his 26th Test century, Rahane has rotated the strike well and kept the scoreboard ticking as South Africa failed to pick up a wicket in the 1st hour on Day 2 despite Vernon Philander coming close a few times.</p>
    <p>With a single off Maharaj, Kohli moves on to 94 and sits just one shot away from a super 100. He doesn't seem in a hurry to get there though, uinlike Mayank yesterday who went from 87 to 103 in just 3 shots: 6, 6, 4!</p>
